# Zhanhong Chen

Hello! My name is Zhanhong Chen, and this is my first repository on GitHub.  
I am interested in statistics, data analysis, and time series methods, and I hope to keep improving my skills while sharing my learning journey here with others.  

During my undergraduate studies, my favourite course was **Time Series** because I enjoyed exploring patterns in data over time.  
My least favourite course was **Calculus**, which I found difficult to enjoy.  
Outside of academics, I like playing **Go**, a traditional board game of strategy.
